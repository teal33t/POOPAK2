Poopak is an open-source research project focusing on dark net markets and hidden services.


We're looking into how anonymous, decentralized networks aided free speech and how a combination of anonymized, decentralized networks like Tor Network or I2P and transparent money transactions like Bitcoin can provide a society with a foundation for transitioning from a state market to a free market.
